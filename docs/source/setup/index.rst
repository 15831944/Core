Setup
#######

This is the guide to getting your Department configured in the resgrid system. This setup guide is a high level overview of the settings to get your department up and running with Resgrid both the OnPrem and Hosted versions of the system. 

.. note:: Only one person in your department or organization needs to sign up for a new Resgrid department, when you create an account from the Resgrid homepage this happens automatically. If this is an on-premises installation, use the default department information to log in.

Getting Started
**************

Once you have your first user registered with Resgrid (or using the default OnPrem department) you can log into the system. The first page you will land on will be the dashboard page or home page. Here is a list of your personnel, groups and their statuses. You can also set your status and staffing level on the widgets on the right hand side. In the top of the screen you can click your name in the left hand side to view or update your profile. The 2 icons in the middle are your active calls and your inbox messages. The menus on the right are your Department Menu (it's the name of your department) and is the primary location to configure your department, a help menu and a logout button.
