Calls & Dispatch
**************

The core part of the Resgrid system is the Calls (Dispatch) facilities. Calls can be created in the system by hand, through external applications or tools, like the Resgrid Responder app or Dispatch app, can be created by importing emails or data payloads like JSON or XML, or even directly by api call.

.. _dispatch_protocols:

Protocols
=======================

Protocols also known as Dispatch Protocols, are department defined procedures, actions, SOPs, etc that should be followed during an operation. For example the most common Protocol in the Resgrid system is the Dispatch version that activates when a new call is created in the system.
